# SUNDIAL

> **Work in progress.** Not yet licensed for reuse; a forkable release is planned after field testing at SUNDIAL 2027. See [FORK-TASKS.md](FORK-TASKS.md).

Nine end-of-life solar panels placed around Bosa, each powering only itself. Same sun, different data.

SUNDIAL is the first work of **PVA (Photovoltaic Art)**, a manifesto for new uses of end-of-life PV panels: [photovoltaic.art](https://photovoltaic.art). It is a public art installation and the proof of concept for PVA. **A SUNDIAL is nine panels;** that is its one rule.

Each panel is three things at once, in order of importance:

1. **A sundial.** A recycled panel on a wall that tells solar time with its gnomon. No visible digital layer: anyone can read it, every day, with no phone.
2. **A self-powered monitor.** Behind the panel, a small board records the panel's own sun every day. The record is collected on foot every fortnight and published on the SUNDIAL website as **Sole**: weekly editions of 63 dials, nine panels by seven days.
3. **An annual event.** Once a year, for about a week, the **event** turns each panel's day of sun into an image drawn live on the visitor's phone through the panel's own Wi-Fi, sealed at sunset. Visitors can leave a line in each panel's book. The week becomes one four-colour screen print.

First event: **SUNDIAL · La Meridiana**, Bosa, summer 2027. SUNDIAL 2027 is a bare-bones trial of the technology and the dial: there is no story or media layer.

The three layers are specified against the carrier board in **[USES.md](USES.md)**. PVA runs all three.

> Status: drafts, not yet compiled or tested on hardware. Firmware draft 6 records everything the dial needs (sun sections, heat, presence); the panel page and `tools/pva_rules.py` both draw rules v1. Firmware 6.2 (security, visitors' book, pages built into the firmware, event archive by year) and the Sole tools are specified in USES.md, not yet written.

## How it fits together

| Layer | What it is | When | Where |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Sundial** | Gnomon, hour brackets and wall plate on the panel ([hardware/SUNDIAL.md](hardware/SUNDIAL.md)) | Always | On the wall |
| **Sole** | The panels' daily record of sun, collected every fortnight, published as weekly editions of 63 dials | All year | The SUNDIAL website |
| **The annual event** | Each day's dial drawn live and sealed at sunset; the visitors' book; one print per event | One week a year | The panel's own Wi-Fi, then the website |

| Part | What it is | Where it runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The panel | PV panel + ESP32 + temperature probe + clock module, no battery, no internet | On a wall in Bosa |
| The dial | Each day's image, drawn on the visitor's phone from the panel's data | The panel's own Wi-Fi during SUNDIAL; the website for Sole |
| The visitors' book | One line per visitor per panel per day, read and chosen the next day | The panel's own Wi-Fi, during SUNDIAL |
| The map | Route, pins, which panels are likely awake, the visitor's position | The SUNDIAL website (this repo's `docs/`) |
| The website pages | SUNDIAL sheets (one per event) and Sole editions (one per week) | The SUNDIAL website (planned: `docs/sundial/`, `docs/sole/`) |
| The girasole | A sunflower and a chalkboard: the Heliotropist legend re-enacted, drawn by visitors | First stop of the route during SUNDIAL, moveable |
| The print | The whole event as one 9 × 9 four-colour screen print | Made after each event from the collected data |

Between events the panel's page shows the archive of past SUNDIAL events, and the panels take no input.

A visit during SUNDIAL: the flyer's QR code opens the map → at a pin, join that panel's Wi-Fi → the dial opens on its own → leave a line in the book → leave the Wi-Fi and return to the map. The rest of the year: read the sundial on the wall; the wall plate's QR code opens the map and Sole.

## Publishing the map

In the repository's GitHub Pages settings, publish from the `docs` folder on the main branch, then point the instance's domain at it (Bosa: `bosa.photovoltaic.art`). Only `docs/` is published; the panel files stay in the repo but never appear online.

Pins are placed on site: open the map with `?edit` after the address, drag the pins, tap **Copy positions** and paste them into the `PANELS` list at the top of `docs/index.html`.

## Preparing a panel

1. **Settings.** Copy `panel_config.example.h` to `panel_config.h` and set the panel's Wi-Fi name (`panel-01` … `panel-09`) and a long, unique admin key. `panel_config.h` is ignored by git; keep the keys somewhere safe.
2. **Build stage.** Set the four switches at the top of the firmware (see the table below). Pins are preset for the ELEGOO 30-pin board; on an ESP32-S3, set them by hand.
3. **Media.** Edit `data/media/title.txt` (panel name) and `data/media/map.txt` (map address).
4. **Build.** Arduino IDE, ESP32 core 3.x; libraries OneWire, DallasTemperature, RTClib. ELEGOO: board *ESP32 Dev Module*, Flash 4 MB, Partition Scheme *Custom* (uses `partitions.csv` in the sketch folder). ESP32-S3: board *ESP32S3 Dev Module*, Flash 16 MB, PSRAM OPI, and rename `partitions_16mb.csv` to `partitions.csv`.
5. **Flash.** Erase all flash first (essential on any board that ever held keys), upload the firmware, then upload `data/` with the LittleFS uploader. **First installation only:** erasing or uploading `data/` wipes the panel's archive and logs. From firmware 6.2 the pages are built into the firmware, and a later update flashes the firmware alone, after a full download (USES.md 4.4).
6. **Set up on site.** Join the panel's Wi-Fi, open `http://192.168.4.1/admin.html`, enter the key, set the clock from your phone and set the exhibition's first and last day.
7. **Calibrate the sun sensor** (if fitted): on a clear day near solar noon, tap **Calibrate now**, **in the two weeks before each event**. On a vertical panel the noon current changes strongly with the season, so the reference must come from the event's own season. Until then the panel still logs the raw current, and the dial's sun sections are drawn as outline.

| Stage | Hardware | `BENCH` | `PANEL_SENSE` | `USE_RTC` | `SUN_SENSE` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1, bench | ESP32 on USB, temperature probe | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1, panel | + panel, buck converter, supercapacitor | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 2, full | + voltage divider, DS3231 clock, protection | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 2, sun | + sun sensor (MOSFET, shunt, INA180) | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| Desk test | any ESP32 on USB, no sensors at all | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0, plus `BENCH_FAKE 1` |

`BENCH_FAKE 1` invents a temperature curve and a sun with passing clouds, so the dial shows every layer on the desk. It refuses to compile unless `BENCH` is 1.

Without the divider (`PANEL_SENSE 0`) there is no dawn gate or dusk close: the supercapacitor smooths the start, and the board simply runs until the light fails. Without the clock (`USE_RTC 0`), the first visitor's phone sets the time each day.

## Installation: the admin checklist (per panel)

**In the workshop**

1. **Settings.** `panel_config.h` from the example: Wi-Fi name (`panel-01` … `panel-09`) and a long, unique admin key, recorded somewhere safe.
2. **Media.** `title.txt` (panel name) and `map.txt` (map address).
3. **Stage switches** to match the hardware fitted. `BENCH` back to `0` before installing.
4. **Flash.** Arduino IDE, ESP32 Dev Module, Custom partitions: erase all flash, upload the firmware, upload `data/` with the LittleFS uploader.
5. **Power chain.** Buck converter set to exactly 5.0 V before anything is connected; then fuse, diode, supercapacitor, TVS.
6. **Sensors.** Probe on GPIO 4 · divider on GPIO 34 · DS3231 on GPIO 21/22 · sun sensor gate on GPIO 25, amplifier on GPIO 35.
7. **Bench test.** On USB: set the clock, set the exhibition dates to today, check status (clock module fitted, probe found, voltage plausible), watch a dial form.
8. **Frame.** Drill from the template; fit the gnomon at 50°, the 13 numbered hour brackets and the stand-off brackets ([hardware/SUNDIAL.md](hardware/SUNDIAL.md)).

**On site**

9. **Permission** from the wall owner and the Comune (and heritage authorities in the centro storico) **for a permanent installation**, plus public liability insurance (USES.md section 5).
10. **Wall test.** Compass for a first reading, then the noon-shadow test: which edge packs out, and by how much.
11. **Mount.** Cut the stand-offs, hang, spirit level against the glass; box on the deep side, probe on the panel back.
12. **Wall plate** beside the panel: its number and the QR code.
13. **Solar-noon check.** The shadow falls on the 12 bracket; adjust the stand-offs if not.
14. **Admin page.** Join the panel's Wi-Fi, open `http://192.168.4.1/admin.html`, enter the key, set the clock and the exhibition dates.
15. **Calibrate the sun sensor** on a clear day near solar noon, in the two weeks before the event starts. Uncalibrated, every section draws as an outline.
16. **Map pin.** Map with `?edit`, drag the pin, copy the positions into `docs/index.html`, push.

**The girasole (once, for the whole trail)**

- **Sow** two or three dwarf sunflowers in large pots in early to mid May, so one is still in bud, and turning with the sun, in the solstice week. Keep the best.
- **Set up** the pot and a chalkboard, with ochre and blue chalk, in front of a south-facing wall: the first stop of the route. It is moveable; place its pin (the flower) with `?edit` like the panels.

**During the run**

17. **Daily round, any time the panels are awake.** Each panel's status; yesterday's visitors' book, ticking the lines to show; a raw-data download (Safari on iPhone or Chrome on Android, not the Wi-Fi pop-up, which cannot save files). At the girasole, at sunset: photograph the chalkboard, then wipe it for the next day; water the plant.
18. **Upkeep.** Clean the glass; replace a failed board or panel. A day lost shows in the gallery as the black outline.

**After the run**

19. **Final walk, the morning after the last day:** read the last book, final download from every panel, clear the raw book entries (setup key). Then the seven chalkboard photographs → canonical sheet and separations → print. **The panels stay up:** the sundial carries on, and so does the record.

**All year (Sole)**

20. **Fortnightly round, every second Monday:** status, clock check, full download, clean the glass, check gnomon, plate and box; one line per panel in the round log. Then import, build the two new weekly editions, push. Details: USES.md 3.2.

**Every year (USES.md 4.4)**

21. **Spring visit:** full download first; firmware only if something changed (never erase, never upload `data/`); check supercaps, coin cell, probe, seals; set the new event's dates.
22. **The two weeks before the event:** calibrate every panel.

## The visitor's experience

1. A flyer or a wall plate: scan the QR code.
2. The map opens on mobile data: the route, the girasole and nine pins, the visitor's own position, which panels are likely awake now.
3. The first stop, the girasole: the legend re-enacted. A young sunflower turning with the sun, and a chalkboard. The visitor adds a mark, ochre for sun or blue for shade, and writes the time beside it.
4. At a pin: a panel, which is also a sundial telling solar time.
5. Join the open Wi-Fi `panel-0N`; the page opens by itself. No internet is involved.
6. Today's dial forming live, or sealed after sunset: the same rule as the chalkboard, drawn by the panel. Tap it for the day's facts.
7. Under today's dial: the visitors' book, one line for this panel. Chosen lines appear the next day.
8. Below: the gallery of earlier days, each with its chosen lines; a day the panel did not wake is the black outline.
9. A strip at the bottom: panel temperature, time awake, sunset.
10. Leave the Wi-Fi, back to the map, on to the next panel.

The visitor's phone counts once per solar hour as a dot on the dial, never identified.

## To do

- [ ] **Import script:** turn an admin download into tile data for `pva_rules.py`, the canonical sheet and the website page.
- [ ] **Separations script:** one file per ink for the screen print.
- [ ] **Website page** for the canonical sheet, filled after each day's round.
- [ ] **Calibration** of every panel before the run; prove the step on the pilot.
- [ ] **"How to read the dial" key** in the panel page's info overlay, as well as on the flyer and website.
- [ ] **Italian and English** on the panel page, info overlay and map.
- [ ] **"Stay connected"** wording on the flyer or wall plate: some phones warn about or drop a network with no internet.
- [x] **After the last day:** the panel page shows the archive of past events (USES.md 4.1).
- [ ] **Firmware 6.2** (USES.md 4.1): challenge-and-response admin login with round and setup keys, lockout and action log; the visitors' book; pages built into the firmware; no visitor clock-setting when the clock module is fitted; rules version check; event archive by year.
- [ ] **Permissions** for a permanent installation: wall owners, Comune and heritage, insurance (USES.md section 5).
- [ ] **Sole tools and pages:** rules-2 in `pva_rules.py`, `pva_import.py`, `sole_edition.py`, `docs/sole/` and `docs/sundial/` (USES.md 3.3–3.4).
- [ ] **First compile and bench test** of firmware draft 6.
- [ ] **The girasole:** sunflower variety and sowing in May; a moveable chalkboard and its stand; where it stands on the route.
- [ ] **Hour lines on the glass** (test on the pilot panel): thin or dotted lines radiating from the gnomon root at the hour-line angles in `hardware/SUNDIAL.md`, in removable UV-stable pinstripe tape first. Measure short-circuit current near solar noon with and without the lines. If the loss is negligible and the dial reads well, keep the lines and shorten the gnomon (safer, less reach from the wall), since the shadow is then read along the line, not at the brackets.

**Optional**

- [ ] **The wall version** (a second artwork, only if time allows): the 63 dials as solar cells, 210 mm squares with 30 mm corner cuts, 2 mm gaps between columns and 4 mm between rows, on a black board, about 1.95 × 1.96 m. Print on Dispa (3.8 mm all-paper board, UV print and machine cut, Pixartprinting) or on laminated card from a copier; proof first. Mock-up: `texts/pva_poster_pv_mockup.pdf`.
- [ ] **Exhibition catalogue:** a bound book of the images, about 70 pages, printed on demand (Pixartprinting): the introduction, the 63 dials one per page, the canonical sheet, how to read a dial, the Heliotropist legend. Check the page count fits their binding (often a multiple of 4).

## Hardware per panel

Each panel is also a vertical sundial, mounted vertical and facing due south: see [hardware/SUNDIAL.md](hardware/SUNDIAL.md) for the gnomon, the drilling template, the installation and the noon-shadow wall test.

**Stage 1:** 36 V 180 W PV panel · DC-DC buck converter (8–60 V in), set to exactly 5.0 V with a multimeter **before** connecting anything · 5.5 V 4 F supercapacitor across the 5 V output (in the shaded box: it ages fast in heat) · ELEGOO ESP32 30-pin on a screw-terminal breakout · DS18B20 waterproof probe on the panel back, data on GPIO 4, 4.7 kΩ from GPIO 4 to 3.3 V.

**Stage 2 adds** (or the carrier board in `hardware/CARRIER.md`, which fits all of this): fuse and reverse-polarity diode on the panel side · SMAJ5.0A TVS diode across 5 V · panel-voltage divider 100 kΩ / 4.7 kΩ + 100 nF into GPIO 34 (must be GPIO 32–39: the other analog pins stop working with Wi-Fi on) · DS3231 clock module on GPIO 21/22.

**Sun sensor:** logic-level N-MOSFET (≥60 V, ≥20 A) across the panel, after an input Schottky diode (≥100 V, ≥15 A, so a reversed panel cannot overheat the MOSFET) and before the fuse and the 1N5408 (the short-circuit current must not run through the fuse), gate on GPIO 25 (100 Ω series, 10 kΩ pull-down) · 5 mΩ shunt in its source leg · INA180A3 (gain 100) across the shunt, on 3.3 V, output to GPIO 35. Every 10 s the panel is shorted for about a millisecond and its short-circuit current read; the supercapacitor carries the board through the pulse. If the shunt or gain differ, change `SHUNT_OHM` and `SENSE_GAIN`.

## The dial (rules v1, draft)

- **Time:** solar noon at the top; 12° per hour; Bosa's solstice day (15 h 03 m) spans 180°, shorter days proportionally less.
- **Sun:** a ring of 15-minute solar sections, ochre when this panel is in direct sun, blue when it is not (shade, cloud, or the sun behind the panel), from a short-circuit current reading (above a third of the panel's clear-noon current = sun).
- **Heat:** a red line rising from the axis, the panel's warming since sunrise; +40 °C reaches the ring, with no upper limit.
- **Presence:** one black dot per solar hour, for visitors in that hour: small 1–5, medium 6–10, large 11+.
- **Seal:** the black horizon line; nothing after sunset enters the dial.
- **A panel that did not wake:** the ring outline and the axis only, in black.
- **Inks:** ochre, red, blue, black, translucent, printed in that order.

*Horas non numero nisi serenas* — I count only the sunny hours.

## What a panel records

| File | Contents | Who sees it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/art/DATE.csv` | every 5 min: volts, temperature, sun current | visitors (exhibition days, sealed at sunset) |
| `/art/DATE.sun.csv` | each 15-minute solar section: sun 1 / 0 / −1 unknown, readings, readings above, mean current | visitors |
| `/art/DATE.vis.csv` | each solar hour: distinct phones | visitors |
| `/log/…`, `/archive/…` | every 5 min record, sun current every minute, visitors per hour, every day | admin only, as one CSV |

## Data and privacy

Visitors are counted, never identified: a phone is told apart only by a salted hash kept in memory for one hour; the salt changes at every power-on and is never stored. The panel keeps no one.

The visitors' book keeps only what the visitor writes: a line and an optional first name or town. Lines are read the next day; chosen lines appear on the panel and the website, the rest are deleted from the panel after the final walk. The full book is kept by PVA for the archive and catalogue.

Raw data stays on each panel and is downloaded only through the admin page; visitors see the exhibition days' images, nothing else. The public website publishes only what the editions need: sun sections, temperatures, visitors per hour, and the day's figures.
